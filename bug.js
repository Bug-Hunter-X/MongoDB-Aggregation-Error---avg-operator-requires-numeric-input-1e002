```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  }
]);
```
This aggregation pipeline attempts to calculate the average age of users grouped by city.  However, if the `age` field is not consistently an integer or number, it can lead to errors.
